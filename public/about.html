<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Manikanta. I'm a 3rd-year BTech student from India, currently specializing in Computer Science. My primary goal is to become a Software Development Engineer (SDE) by 2026.<br /> I'm deeply focused on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), web development, Python (AI), and system design, aiming to build a strong foundation in software engineering.<br />

  I’m also preparing for placements starting in July 2025, working on competitive programming (LeetCode, Codeforces) and expanding my knowledge in cloud computing (AWS, Azure), DBMS, operating systems, and computer networks. Additionally, I’m passionate about motivational content and Stoicism, and I’ve started a YouTube channel in that niche.
  
  Apart from academics, I aspire to study abroad for an MS in CS-related courses in London after completing my BTech in 2026.<br /> I’m driven by the goal of proving myself in the next 7-8 months and supporting my family.
  
  I believe in consistent learning, self-discipline, and pushing my limits to achieve my dreams. Looking forward to growing and making an impact in the tech industry</p>
